## Hey there 👩🏻‍💻👋

I'm Flor _(she/her)_, a software engineer with a love for design and outdoor adventures 🏕️. 

I'm currently working in Glovo <img src="https://cdn.icon-icons.com/icons2/2699/PNG/512/glovoapp_logo_icon_169104.png" height="12"/> as a **Senior Software Engineer** specialised in the Frontend but working on becoming a Full-Stack by improving my Backend expertise. I love puzzles and breaking down problems into smaller challenges. I'm driven by my willingness to help and achieve continuous improvement.

Feel free to [reach out](mailto:tardittimf@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hello!) and talk about coding, running, mountains or plants! 🪴
